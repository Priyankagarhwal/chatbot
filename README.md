# 🤖 NLP Chatbot using spaCy (College FAQ Bot)

A simple yet powerful chatbot built using Python and spaCy that can answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to a college campus. This project showcases how natural language processing (NLP) can be applied to build interactive and helpful assistants.


## 🚀 Features

- Answers predefined college-related FAQs (e.g. admission, exams, events).
- Classifies questions into categories using spaCy NLP pipelines.
- Easily extendable to support resume tips or placement queries.
- CLI-based interaction (can be extended to web or app).


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.7+
- **NLP Library**: spaCy
- **Data Handling**: JSON



## 🧠 How it Works

1. User types a query.
2. The query is processed using spaCy NLP.
3. The bot classifies the query and returns the most relevant predefined answer.
